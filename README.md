*DESCRIPTION*: A Real-Time Chat Application enables users to communicate instantly, with messages delivered and displayed without needing to refresh the page. This project uses WebSockets for continuous two-way communication between clients and the server, making interactions fast and seamlessâ€”similar to popular platforms like WhatsApp or Slack.

The frontend is built using React.js (or Vue.js), allowing for a dynamic and responsive user interface. React handles rendering and updating UI components efficiently based on real-time data changes. The design is made responsive using CSS or frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap, ensuring the chat interface works well on mobile and desktop devices.

On the backend, Node.js with Express.js serves the application and handles routing. Real-time communication is powered by Socket.io, which simplifies WebSocket connections between the server and clients. Messages are broadcast instantly to all users, and a basic message history is maintained during the session.

Tools and Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js (or Vue.js), CSS/Tailwind CSS, Socket.io-client

Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Socket.io

Development: npm/yarn, Visual Studio Code, browser dev tools


Benefits:

Enables fast, live communication between users

Builds practical experience with modern web technologies

Can be scaled with features like authentication, file sharing, and message persistence


Deliverable: A working, real-time chat interface that is responsive and includes basic message history.
